# My Environment for Win32

This repository is another "memory hole" repository that will hold my win32
environment setup.
  * Scripts: This hold all sample (and full) scripts that I use.
    * autorun.bat is an script designed for whenever cmd.exe is opened.
    * git.bat is a script that tells me what branch i'm in (not mine!)
    * setup_cl.bat is a script that fetches vsvarsall.bat (not mine!)
    * shell.bat uses the other scripts, and uses subst, to start working
  * Vim: This is my vim setup. its not a perfect setup!
    * Uses Amix's Vim Awesome - https://github.com/amix/vimrc.git.
    * The only thing that of mine is - .vim_runtime\my_configs.vim
    * Designed to be drag & drop.
